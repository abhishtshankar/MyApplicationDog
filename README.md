The code is written in Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It consists of three main activities (MainActivity, DogDetailsActivity, and RecentDogsActivity) along with a MainViewModel class and a CacheManager object to handle caching of recently generated dog image URLs.

The MainActivity serves as the main screen and contains buttons to generate random dog images and view recently generated dog images. Clicking on the "Generate Dogs" button opens the DogDetailsActivity, where random dog images can be generated. Clicking on the "My Recently Generated Dogs" button opens the RecentDogsActivity, where recently generated dog images are displayed in a horizontal RecyclerView. The "Clear Dogs" button in RecentDogsActivity allows the user to clear the list of recently generated dog images.

The MainViewModel class can be used to add any necessary logic or data related to the main screen.

The CacheManager object is responsible for handling the caching of recently generated dog image URLs. It stores the URLs in a list, and the list is updated when new dog images are generated or cleared.

Overall, the code follows the MVVM architecture, separating the business logic and data from the UI components.
